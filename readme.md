## FDDPS: Fault Detection, Diagnosis and Prognosis System
This project was completed within 40 hours for DMC Hackathon in July 2016. The hackathon brought professional programmers, data miners and business professionals around the nation to Chicago to develop innovative technological solutions for leveraging manufacturing industry.

Our team project, Fault Detection, Diagnosis and Prognosis System (FDDPS), is a machine monitering system that integrates both descriptive and predictive information for users to be informed with real-time machinery status. With the implementation of recommender system and stochastic modeling, our system is able to help manufacturers to reduce the loss of revenue during unplanned downtime and maintenance, and to increase the manufacturing efficiency.
